# CVI Longitudinal Analysis ðŸ•‘

## Introduction


## Exploratory Analyses


The files *Severity Metric Exploratory Analysis.ipynb* and *County-Level Exploration - Severity Metric -Updated.ipynb* contain the exploratory analyses. To facilitate greater understanding, we also developed a Streamlit app to explore the analyses discussed above for each year. The deployed exploratory analysis app can be found at https://cvi-longitudinal-analysis.herokuapp.com/.
